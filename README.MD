The project will read from text file and output (chosen by the user) the specific number of times a variable appears in that text file. 

I did particularly well modularizing the itemcounter as it can be used to read any text file instead of my original approach to limit to specific txt file.

I could enhance my code by making it more modular. My main has more code than necessary and at this moment main file needs to be specified which txt file to open.

The most challenging portion of the code was definitely the itemCounter as it was quite difficult organizing and quite a few times would not budge on the count or would not work at all.

I believe the thinking and organization is particularly transferable skill I learned in this project. The hardest part of creating new program is knowing how to organize your thoughts.

Adding comments definitely immediately after each line helps. Before, I would add comments after finishing the code.
